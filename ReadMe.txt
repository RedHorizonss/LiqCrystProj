This repo is for the Computing Mini Project SCIFM0004.

This project is based on the Lebwohl-Lasher Model of Liquid Crystals, in which it is expected from us to find and analyse the parts of the code that are doing the most work using profiling. Afterwards we are tasked to improve the speed and efficency of the code using these methods:
    • Mpi4py run on multiple cores
    • Cythonize functions and apply multi-threading
    • NumPy vectorization to speed up the calculations (random to sequential sampling?)
    • Numba Aand the relevant possibiltes with it

These methods should all be in their own seperate python file, the changed code should be tested to see if they are faster. In addition the code should be tested to check if it is reproducing the same results as the original code.
